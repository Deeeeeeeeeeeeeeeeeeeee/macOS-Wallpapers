# macOS X Wallpapers
WIP!

An archive of every macOS X wallpaper officially released by Apple

This repository aims to preserve every macOS X wallpaper released by Apple, all the way from macOS 10.0 up to (currently) macOS 15 Sequoia.
Wallpapers are sorted by os version.

All wallpapers are extracted directly from `/System/Desktop Pictures` and have not been touched in any way.

> Video wallpapers are not currently included. Only static, dynamic and light/dark pictures.

## How to add the wallpapers to system settings
1. In your terminal make a Desktop Pictures folder: `mkdir /Library/Desktop\ Pictures`
2. And a thumbnail folder therein: `mkdir /Library/Desktop\ Pictures/.thumbnails`
> Not `System/Library/Desktop Pictures` or `~/Library/Desktop Pictures`!
3. Navigate to `/Library/Desktop Pictures` by opening Finder and pressing `shift + command + G`
4. Copy your desired wallpapers into the folder, and their thumbnails into the `.thumbnails` folder
> if you don't see the `.thumbnails` folder, press `shift + command + .` to show hidden folders
5. ???
6. Profit
7. Your wallpapers should now appear in system settings alongside the built-in wallpapers
